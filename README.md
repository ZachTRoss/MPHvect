This repository contains a Python implementation of the method of using iterative triangulations to vectorize signed barcodes of multiparameter persistence. This method is described in detail in described in:  Peter Bubenik &amp; Zachariah Ross, "A Schauder Basis for Multiparameter Persistence", arXiv:2510.10347
